## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first step in understanding the structure, patterns and anomalies in data, while feature engineering transforms raw data into suitable formats for model training. This repository showcases these essential steps applied to a variety of real-world datasets.

## Repository Structure

- `BlackFridayAnalysis/` – Retail purchasing trends during Black Friday  
- `DiwaliSalesAnalysis/` – Festive season consumer behaviour  
- `FlightPriceAnalysis/` – Airline fare prediction data  
- `GooglePlayStoreAnalysis/` – Mobile app insights from Google Play  
- `HeartAnalysis/` – Heart disease prediction data  
- `NetflixAnalysis/` – Content distribution and trends on Netflix  
- `OlympicsAnalysis/` – Historical Olympics data exploration  
- `OrdersAnalysis/` – E-commerce order history analysis  
- `UberAnalysis/` – Ride-sharing patterns in urban areas  
- `ZomatoAnalysis/` – Restaurant reviews and food delivery trends  
- `BigO/` – Complexity trends and algorithm benchmarks  
- `Pyspark/` – Feature engineering using PySpark

## Purpose

- To practice EDA and uncover hidden trends in diverse datasets  
- To apply domain-specific transformations for meaningful insights  
- To build a foundational understanding of data wrangling and feature creation  
- To serve as a learning resource for aspiring data scientists


## Tools and Technologies

- Python   
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- scikit-learn (for preprocessing)  
- PySpark (for scalable data engineering)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DebarjunChakraborty/EDA-and-Feature-Engineering.git
cd EDA-and-Feature-Engineering
```

2. Open any notebook of interest using Jupyter:  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Explore the notebooks, each with self-contained EDA and preprocessing steps.
